# Best Practices

This document outlines best practices for machine learning projects in this repository.

## Code Organization

### 1. Project Structure

- Keep each project in its own directory under `projects/`
- Separate concerns: data processing, model definition, training, evaluation
- Use configuration files for hyperparameters and settings

### 2. Naming Conventions

- Use descriptive names for files and functions
- Follow PEP 8 style guide for Python code
- Name notebooks with numbers for ordering: `01_exploration.ipynb`, `02_modeling.ipynb`

### 3. Documentation

- Write docstrings for all functions and classes
- Include a README.md in each project directory
- Document your experiments and findings

## Data Management

### 1. Data Storage

- Never commit large datasets to Git
- Store data in the `data/` directory with appropriate subdirectories
- Keep raw data immutable; always work with copies

### 2. Data Versioning

- Use descriptive filenames with dates or versions
- Document data sources and preprocessing steps
- Consider using tools like DVC for data version control

### 3. Data Privacy

- Never commit sensitive or personal data
- Anonymize data when necessary
- Follow data protection regulations (GDPR, etc.)

## Model Development

### 1. Experimentation

- Track experiments systematically (MLflow, TensorBoard, Weights & Biases)
- Set random seeds for reproducibility
- Document hyperparameters and results

### 2. Code Quality

- Write modular, reusable code
- Use functions and classes appropriately
- Keep functions short and focused on a single task

### 3. Version Control

- Commit frequently with descriptive messages
- Use branches for new features or experiments
- Tag important milestones and releases

## Model Training

### 1. Reproducibility

- Set random seeds everywhere (numpy, tensorflow, torch, etc.)
- Document the environment (Python version, package versions)
- Save model architecture, hyperparameters, and training configuration

### 2. Validation

- Always use separate train/validation/test sets
- Use cross-validation when appropriate
- Be careful of data leakage

### 3. Monitoring

- Monitor training progress (loss, metrics)
- Implement early stopping
- Save checkpoints during training

## Model Evaluation

### 1. Metrics

- Choose appropriate metrics for your task
- Report multiple metrics (not just accuracy)
- Consider business metrics alongside technical ones

### 2. Error Analysis

- Analyze model errors and failures
- Use confusion matrices, error plots
- Understand when and why the model fails

### 3. Testing

- Test on held-out data
- Consider edge cases and adversarial examples
- Test model performance across different data subgroups

## Deployment Considerations

### 1. Model Serialization

- Use appropriate formats (pickle, joblib, SavedModel, ONNX)
- Version your models
- Test loading and inference

### 2. Performance

- Optimize model size if needed
- Consider inference speed
- Batch predictions when possible

### 3. Monitoring

- Monitor model performance in production
- Detect concept drift
- Plan for model updates

## Collaboration

### 1. Code Reviews

- Review code before merging
- Provide constructive feedback
- Follow project coding standards

### 2. Communication

- Document decisions and rationale
- Share findings and insights
- Ask for help when needed

### 3. Knowledge Sharing

- Write clear documentation
- Share useful resources and references
- Mentor others when possible

## Security

### 1. Dependencies

- Keep dependencies up to date
- Review security advisories
- Use virtual environments

### 2. Secrets Management

- Never commit API keys, passwords, or tokens
- Use environment variables for secrets
- Use `.gitignore` appropriately

### 3. Model Security

- Be aware of adversarial attacks
- Validate inputs
- Consider model privacy (differential privacy, federated learning)

## Performance Optimization

### 1. Computational Efficiency

- Profile your code to identify bottlenecks
- Use vectorized operations (numpy, pandas)
- Consider parallel processing when appropriate

### 2. Memory Management

- Use generators for large datasets
- Clear memory when objects are no longer needed
- Monitor memory usage

### 3. GPU Utilization

- Use mixed precision training when possible
- Optimize batch sizes
- Monitor GPU utilization

## Continuous Learning

- Stay updated with latest research and techniques
- Experiment with new tools and frameworks
- Learn from failures and mistakes
- Document lessons learned
