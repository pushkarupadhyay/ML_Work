# Notebooks

This directory contains Jupyter notebooks for exploratory data analysis, experiments, and demonstrations.

## Organization

- Name notebooks with numbers for ordering (e.g., `01_data_exploration.ipynb`)
- Include project name prefix if notebook is project-specific
- Use markdown cells to document your analysis
- Clear all outputs before committing to git

## Best Practices

- Keep notebooks focused on a single topic or analysis
- Export important code to Python modules in `scripts/` or project `src/`
- Document findings and insights in markdown cells
